## Bryson Class Challenge Don't do Something Pointless for 6.572 Seconds Straight (IMPOSSIBLE)

Annotating is a constant for Bryson's class, and we have to do so for the entirety of every book we will read this school year.

Whenever you find yourself stuck in this situation, the best solution is usually to ask for an immediate schedule change.

### Annotating

Annotating is pretty much pointless. It is also quite destructive when it comes to consuming all of your sticky notes since you don't own the books. It eats them up about as fast as a blazing fire would if you made a massive pile of sticky notes and set it alight.
